## TODO ##
- finish physical projectile
	deal damage
	can apply effects, e.g. knockback, status
- create visual projectile



## THOUGHTS ##

do we need to differentiate between visual and physical projectiles?
projectile needs max travel distance and if 0, minimum duration (to allow hit registers)
look at adding the signal visualiser add on, as signals are already getting messy
