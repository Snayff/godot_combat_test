## TODO ##
- finish physical projectile
	travel range is handled by resource that drains on distance travelled
		?projectile needs max travel distance and if 0, minimum duration (to allow hit registers)?
	knockback
	physics modifiers
- create visual projectile
	? do we need to differentiate between visual and physical projectiles?
- effects
	apply status effects
		? on_trigger and connect to a relevant signal?
